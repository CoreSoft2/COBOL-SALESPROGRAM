# COBOL-SALES PROGRAM
  This program is used to take multiple input files and then preform various operations such as sorting, modifying, and data intregrity and validity checks. This program begins by opening the declared input files, then it will access each file and manually check the data and sort it, if there are any bad records found, the program will remove the record and store it in a seperate file. Once this is done, the program will add the record into a master file that lists all records. The program will do this for each file, and at the end will have a master file that has all correct data merged from the input files and a bad-data file that contains bad entries. 
  This program then goes creates a formatting style and then uses the master data file to fill the format created. This program will then expand and work with the data provided to then give a sales report for the user and the provided input files. Three example input files have been provided which can be used to show how the information is laid out and how the program reads it. These three example files are for a salesman and the inventory he has at 3 different warehouses. Although there are only 3 provided files, this program can still operate with more or less files, as long as changes are made to the ENVIROMENT-DIVISION to accomodate the input.
